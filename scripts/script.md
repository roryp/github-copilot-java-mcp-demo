# Demo Recording Script — Java Spring Boot + MCP + Copilot

**Repo:** https://github.com/roryp/vscode-learn

## Episode 1 of 4 — Build and debug your first Spring Boot app

### Intro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I'll build and debug a Spring Boot app in VS Code. I'll install the Java and Spring extension packs, scaffold the app with Spring Initializr, and run it directly from the editor. Then I'll use breakpoints to step through the code and Actuator for live runtime insight. Let's jump right in.

**Do:** End on “let's jump right in,” then cut to screen share.

### Demo — Build & run

| Where | Do | Say |
|-------|----|-----|
| VS Code — Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) | Search **"Extension Pack for Java"** and install. Then install a **JDK 25** (Ctrl+Shift+P → *Java: Install New JDK*, or show it already installed). | "Let's start from nothing. First I install the Extension Pack for Java — that gives me language support, debugging, Maven, and testing in one bundle — plus a JDK to compile and run." |
| Extensions view | Search **"Spring Boot Extension Pack"** (Spring Boot Tools, Dashboard, Initializr) and install. | "Next, the Spring Boot Extension Pack. This adds the Spring Initializr, the Spring Boot Dashboard, and smart editing for Spring config." |
| Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) | Run **"Spring Initializr: Create a Maven Project"**. Choose: Spring Boot 4.1.x → Java → group `com.example` → artifact `springboot-mcp-demo` → Java 25 → dependencies **Spring Web**, **Thymeleaf**, **Actuator**. | "The Initializr scaffolds a project right inside VS Code — no browser needed. I pick Web, Thymeleaf, and Actuator to get started." |
| Explorer + editor | Open the finished version of this project (the one I prepared earlier) from the repo https://github.com/roryp/vscode-learn. Show `TodoController`, `TodoService`, `TodoRepository`, `Todo`, and `templates/index.html`. | "To save time, here's one I built earlier with those exact choices — same structure. One `TodoService` holds the logic; a Thymeleaf page and controller give us a simple web UI backed by an in-memory store." |
| Terminal | `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` — then open http://localhost:8080. Add a todo, toggle it, delete it. | "Build and run with the Maven wrapper. There's our Todo app — add, complete, delete. Classic Spring Boot web app." |

**The running Todo web app:**

### Demo — Debug & watch memory

| Where | Do | Say |
|-------|----|-----|
| Editor — `TodoController.java` | Click the gutter to set a **breakpoint** on the `addForm` method (the `service.add(title)` line). | "Let's debug. I'll drop a breakpoint where a new todo gets created." |
| Spring Boot Dashboard / Run view | Start the app with **F5** (Debug). In the browser add a todo to hit the breakpoint. | "Launch in debug mode with F5, add a todo, and execution pauses right on our line." |
| Debug toolbar + Variables panel | Step over (`F10`), inspect `title` and the returned `Todo` in **Variables**. Continue (`F5`). | "I can step through, inspect the incoming title and the saved Todo — full breakpoint debugging, no extra setup." |
| Spring Boot Dashboard → running app → **Memory** view (or Actuator) | Open the **Actuator / Memory** view; show heap/non-heap live gauges. Also hit http://localhost:8080/actuator/health. | "Because we added Actuator, VS Code gives me a live Memory view and health endpoint — real-time JVM insight while the app runs." |

**Actuator health endpoint (all systems UP):**

### Outro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I built and ran a Spring Boot app in VS Code, debugged it with breakpoints, and inspected its health and memory with Actuator. That gave me one workflow for setup, development, and runtime diagnostics. In the next video, I'll connect the app to GitHub Copilot through MCP.

## Episode 2 of 4 — Expose your endpoints to Copilot with MCP

### Intro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I'll turn a Spring Boot Todo app into tools GitHub Copilot can call directly. I'll use Spring AI to expose the existing Java operations through MCP, while keeping the web UI and Copilot connected to the same service. Let's jump right in.

**Do:** End on “let's jump right in,” then cut to screen share.

### Demo

| Where | Do | Say |
|-------|----|-----|
| `pom.xml` | Show the dependency **`spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webmvc`** and the `spring-ai-bom` 2.0.0. | "To turn my app into tools an AI agent can call, I add one dependency: the Spring AI MCP server." |
| `mcp/TodoTools.java` | Walk through the `@McpTool` / `@McpToolParam` annotations on `addTodo`, `listTodos`, etc. Point out they just delegate to `TodoService`. | "Each method gets an `@McpTool` annotation with a name and description. They reuse the exact same service the web UI uses — no duplicated logic. Five tools: list, get, add, complete, delete." |
| `application.properties` | Highlight `spring.ai.mcp.server.protocol=STREAMABLE`. | "One critical setting: `protocol=STREAMABLE`. The WebMVC starter defaults to the old SSE transport — without this, `/mcp` returns 404." |
| Terminal (restart app) | `.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run` and point to the log line **`Registered tools: 5`**. | "Restart, and the log confirms all five tools are registered and served at `/mcp`." |
| `.vscode/mcp.json` | Show the `todo-mcp` HTTP server entry; click the **Start** code-lens. | "This file points VS Code at my server over HTTP. I start it right from the editor." |
| Copilot Chat (Agent mode) | Enable the `todo-mcp` tools. Ask: *"Use the todo-mcp tools to add a todo called 'Email the stakeholders', then list all todos."* Refresh http://localhost:8080. | "Now in Agent mode I ask Copilot to add a todo and list them. It calls my Java code as tools — and the new item shows up in the web UI. Same data, driven by AI." |

**Proof it works — a todo created *through MCP* appears in the web UI** (last row):

![Todo added via MCP](../docs/images/03-mcp-added-todo.png)

**Copilot Chat calling the `todo-mcp` tools — the `add_todo` call and its JSON result:**

![Copilot Chat todo-mcp tool call](../docs/images/06-copilot-mcp-chat.png)

### Outro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I exposed the Todo operations as MCP tools and connected them to GitHub Copilot. Because Copilot and the web UI shared the same Java service, changes made in chat appeared immediately in the app. In the next video, I'll test the UI in a real browser with Playwright.

---

## Episode 3 of 4 — Let Copilot test it with Playwright

### Intro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I'll show how to test a Spring Boot web app with Copilot and Playwright. Passing unit tests don't prove the UI works for a real user, so I'll have Copilot drive the app in a real browser and verify the experience end to end. Let's jump right in.

**Do:** End on “let's jump right in,” then cut to screen share.

### Demo

| Where | Do | Say |
|-------|----|-----|
| `templates/index.html` | Point out the `data-testid` hooks: `new-todo-input`, `add-todo`, `todo-item`, `delete-todo`. | "I added stable test IDs to the UI so automation has reliable selectors." |
| Copilot Chat (Agent mode, Playwright MCP) | Ask Copilot to use the **Playwright** tools to open http://localhost:8080, add a todo, complete it, and delete it. | "Using the Playwright MCP server, I let Copilot drive a real browser — add, complete, delete — end to end, no test code written by hand." |
| Browser window (Playwright) | Watch the automated browser perform the add → complete → delete flow. | "There it goes: filling the input, clicking add, toggling, deleting — a full UI smoke test." |
| Terminal | Run the JSON-RPC smoke test: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\mcp-smoke-test.ps1` (app running). Show `tools/list` and `add_todo` succeeding. Also run `.\mvnw.cmd test`. | "For a scripted check, this smoke test does the raw MCP handshake — initialize, list tools, call add_todo — the same protocol Copilot uses. And `mvnw test` covers the service, web UI, and MCP context." |

**Actual smoke-test output (verified):**

```text
1. initialize  -> server: todo-mcp-server v1.0.0  (session ...)
2. notifications/initialized -> sent
3. tools/list  -> 5 tools: add_todo, complete_todo, delete_todo, get_todo, list_todos
4. tools/call add_todo -> {"id":4,"title":"Created through the MCP add_todo tool","completed":false,...}

MCP smoke test PASSED.
```

**Playwright driving the UI mid-run — auto-captured by `scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs`:**

### Outro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I used Copilot and Playwright to test the Todo app in a real browser, then backed that up with automated checks across the application. That covered both the user experience and the code behind it. In the next video, I'll delegate a complete feature to the Copilot coding agent.

## Episode 4 of 4 — Hand a feature to the Copilot cloud agent

### Intro — Talking head (~15s)

> In this video, I'll hand a complete Spring Boot feature to the GitHub Copilot coding agent and review the pull request it creates. The task spans persistence, due dates, and tests, so I can evaluate how the agent handles one clearly scoped change. Let's jump right in.

**Do:** End on “let's jump right in,” then cut to screen share.

### Demo

| Where | Do | Say |
|-------|----|-----|
| `docs/copilot-agent-issue.md` | Open it; show the ready-to-assign task: add **Spring Data JPA + H2** persistence and a **`dueDate`** field with filtering. | "Todos are in memory on purpose. Here's a ready-to-go issue asking for real persistence and a due-date feature." |
| GitHub — new issue | Paste the issue content, create it, and **assign it to @copilot** (or use *Delegate to coding agent* in the GitHub Pull Requests view). | "I assign this to the Copilot coding agent — it works asynchronously in the cloud, just like a teammate." |
| GitHub Pull Requests view (VS Code) | Wait for the agent to open a **pull request**; open it and review the diff (new JPA entity, repository, `dueDate`, tests). | "A few minutes later the agent opens a pull request — JPA entity, Spring Data repository, the new field, and updated tests." |
| PR review | Skim the changes, leave a comment or approve, then merge. | "I review, comment if needed, and merge. From a web app, to MCP tools, to an AI-built feature — all inside VS Code." |

**The issue assigned to the Copilot coding agent (@copilot) — auto-captured by `scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs`:**

![Issue assigned to Copilot](../docs/images/08-issue-assigned.png)

**The pull request the Copilot agent opened — its diff (13 files: new JPA entity, repository, `dueDate`, tests) — auto-captured by `scripts/screenshots/capture.mjs`:**

![Agent pull request](../docs/images/09-agent-pr.png)

### Outro — Talking head (~20s)

> In this video, I gave the Copilot coding agent a scoped feature request and reviewed the pull request it produced. The change added persistence, due dates, and tests, while I kept control of the final review and merge decision. The agent handled the implementation; I remained responsible for what shipped.

**Do:** Hold on the completed pull request, then fade out.
